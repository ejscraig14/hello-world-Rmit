        I was born in Sydney, Australia in 1996. My father is the descendent of Scottish immigrants,
        whilst my mother is half Japanese and half French-Canadian. My grandmother on my mother’s side was from Hiroshima, and was
        present for the nuclear bomb on the Monday, the 6th of August 1945. She later met my grandfather during the Korean War in the
        50’s when he was sent to Japan for medical attention. Through this, I’ve had exposure to more than just the dominant culture
        in Australia, however I do not speak a single word of Japanese or any other language! I’ve previously attempted Spanish, French
        and Japanese in high school and previous studies but have found it difficult to continue my studies due to not having a
        consistent level of practice.

        Earlier this year, I graduated from the University of Sydney with a Bachelors of Arts. I majored in Socio-Legal Studies and
        History. Socio-Legal studies is a stem of sociology, which examines the interactions between a chaotic society with a constructed
        as well as organized legal system. Moreover, my history major found me specialising in early modern history with close attention
        on areas of geo-political conflict, such as that still found in Israel and Palestine or even closer to home  in Australia with
        Sydney’s green ban activists in the 1970s. Although I gained alot of knowledge from these studies, I found the most enriching
        experience being that it developed my critical thought allowing myself to search for ideas outside the regular approach to
        issues and present them in ways that are plowerful, understandable and meaningful.

        <br>
        My Hobbies: Luckily I was privileged enough in my childhood to start studying music at a young age. I mainly played saxophone
        but my passion grew immensely in all areas of music.

        For myself, I find music as an outlet for expression that has no boundaries such as language and musical knowledge. Through
        this I’ve found myself loving a variety of music from hip hop to Nigerian afrobeat. Personally, I find that everyone levitates
        towards music that provides a rich, deep and provocative connection to us on an individual level. Although I truly cannot
        truly identify with the political struggles of Fela Kuti of the 1970s, his music projects and unravels the complexity of
        his movement.

  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>

    <p>
        My interest in the field of technology started quite comically. I was visiting my local McDonalds late at night after finishing
        exams in early 2018, and had found that many of the tellers had been replaced with digital kiosks. Myself at the time was working
        in Hospitality and found this extremely strange that they had decided to cut out a major human element of their experience. Soon
        after I found a Forbes article (LINK) reporting on this change occurring in America. From this I began to understand the power
        of technology and IT, especially in the fields of automation in the workplace as large businesses are now able to increase
        efficiency, cut labour costs and increase customer convenience. This power has seemed to make its way into every industry from
        finance to technology with protocols being managed through automation rather than manual labour, showcasing their
        power and for myself sparking my interest.
        <br>
        <br>
        My experience in Information Technology is limited. Throughout high school, I was taught Information Technologies in a
        rudimentary war in our Industrial Technologies classes. Exterior to formal education, I had attempted a few coding courses
        but failed through my own personal determination. However, computers have always been an interest of mine through both their
        application in music creation and gaming. This has led myself to have built and have a limited working knowledge of the
        hardware side of computers.
        <br>
        <br>

        RMIT was an easy choice due to the recognition it gained nationally. Specifically, I chose this course as it aims to build a solid foundational
        understanding and will fill the gaps in my knowledge already. Due to Covid, my graduation has been delayed limiting myself from
        post-graduate degrees and RMIT offered this course as well as an Introduction to Programming as undergraduate paths for myself to
        gain a greater understanding of technology.
        <br>
        <br>
        Through my studies, I wish to gain knowledge and experience with working with technology. Previously I attended university to
        educate myself on how I learn and how to adapt to information that is presented to myself. By re-engaging in the education
        system I wish to learn about a field I’m passionate about and bring my previous education as a refreshing perspective.

  <h2>Ideal Job</h2>

    <p>
      Cisco’s role as a Cloud Software Engineer has the responsibility to develop and build Software-as-a-service products (SaaS),
      which alongside IaaS and Paas are the major categories of cloud computing. SaaS products are utilised on a daily basis by most
      businesses and examples include DropBox and Cisco’s own Webex. This role has aspects of hands-on implementation and personal
      influence over the production of the product. The role itself is appealing to myself for two major reasons, firstly being that
      Cloud based products, specifically SaaS are growing in implementation exponentially. ZDnet reports that revenue from SaaS services will
      double both PaaS and IaaS products by 2021. (LINK). Secondly, Cisco as a company is reportedly the greatest workplaces in the world according to
      Forbes (LINK). Cisco offers a healthy corporate environment and prioritises their employees well being highly on their list. Moreover, with Cisco
      bringing in Chuck Robbins as CEO, they have refocused on their green initiatives and corporate responsibility. Through their heritage and corporate
      culture, Cisco as a whole is a very
      alluring opportunity.
     <br>
     <br>
      For this role a level of technical skills is necessary to succeed. Firstly, the role calls for 5-10 years of experience with
      a formal education level of at least a Bachelors or Masters degree in Computer Engineering. Moreover, it requires previous
      working experience with Linux systems, some level of understanding of virtualisation, containers and microservices. Thirdly,
      the role requires experience in working with a log management tool such as ELK stack. Additionally, the right candidate
      will be able to design and develop customised tools, scripts and dashboards. A necessity outlined is also prior knowledge
      of cloud deployment technologies, such as Docker or Kubernetes. This needs to be paired alongside Test Driven Development
      (TDD). Crucially, the candidate must have four or more years of experience working with one or more programming languages,
      including Python, Java or Go. Finally, the successful candidate will also have over 2 years of experience in Agile
      engineering and with Cloud computing such as AWS or Azure.
      <br>
      <br>
      My personal experience isn’t relative to this job currently. But I do have five years of experience in the hospitality industry
      enabling myself for great communication both verbal and written. Moreover, with my time in this industry I was also a manager
      and have learnt to be effective in a team atmosphere enabling for more effective outcomes in group based efforts. For my hard
      skills, I have previously completed a bachelors of arts, that has developed my personal analytical thinking and ability to
      present both outcomes and challenges effectively to an audience. Currently, I am completing two undergraduate courses at RMIT,
      Intro to Programming and Intro to Information Technology. The first, has introduced myself to the Java language and its
      applications, whilst Intro to IT hopefully will help me engage with more complex technologies in the future allowing myself a
      greater understanding of this area.
      <br>
      <br>
      By returning to study, I hope to refocus myself towards the technology industry. By completing these units I hope to build a
      functional understanding that I can build upon through learning more programming languages and their applications.
      Furthermore, I will continue to study once I’ve officially graduated to gain a further understanding in Computer Science,
      which is outlined as a necessity for this role. Another path I will develop myself on is through participating in internships
      when I am available to do so. By having such experience I will have a more rounded understanding of the practical processes
      in the field. By the end of my studies, I will hopefully look for graduate programs, which Cisco offers. Through such a
      program with a company that uses Cloud technologies, I can enhance my theoretical and practical understandings in the role.
      Through my working experience, hopefully I will have the opportunity to move into a role similar or in relation to this
      allowing myself to work closely with those who are already Cloud Software Engineers, by doing so I will be able to work
      on my already developed personal skills and apply for the position once it is available again.

    <p>
      The above results for myself aren’t truly representative of the truth. Firstly, personality tests within a corporate setting are highly criticised as
      they can only be used as an indicator of potential behaviour. Secondly, I found myself throughout the actual tests unsure of my own personal responses
      to some of the questions as the answers were definitive and we as people cannot be so definitive with our social interactions. Moreover, the results
      themselves in relation to my teamwork seem somewhat accurate, I do not attempt to come across result driven and endeavour to try help everyone find
      some worth from the task. When taking these results in forming a team, they can be detrimental to your own work as they don’t fully represent the
      relationships and previous experience a member could bring to your project. Whilst forming a team it is more important to have meaningful
      conversations about our mentality towards the work to understand how we all feel as a whole and that will hopefully lead towards truthful
      representations of our own progress in our task as well as how other members can step in to help one another.

  <h2>Project Ideas</h2>

    <p>
        My proposed project is an automated workstation. This will allow users to have full control over their workstation, including
        desk height, monitor configuration and the ability to save settings for different occasions. This will be all motorised, and
        will have the ability be controlled both by physical controller and smart home audio commands. Due to the amount of processes
        and inputs necessary for this project, a Raspberry Pi is needed to process and store multiple variables and execute actions
        simultaneously. By doing so, it enables the user to find themselves in control and able to have a more flexible workspace
        that will help with project and work efficiency.
    <br>
    <br>
        As the global context of working from home rises, we are seeing a necessity to have a flexible and personalisable workspace at
        home again. As of 2016, 67% of people have a desktop computer at home and understand the challenges of having to sit at a
        stationary desk, with a monitor that is still on a wobbly factory stand. Through using a raspberry pi, motorised vesa mount
        and a motorised desk we enable us to work in our own personalised space consistently. Moreover, for those who choose to use
        multiple monitors are led to the question of “what is the most effective monitor configuration for myself?”, a question that
        an automated workstation would make redundant.
    <br>
    <br>
        The major features of this project would be the customizability of desk height and monitors. Moreover, it would also feature
        a physical controller alongside smart home commands to control movement in the desk and mounts.
    <br>
    <br>
        Adjustable desks are becoming more common and affordable through retailers such as IKEA. However, higher end models utilise
        motors in the legs to adjust their heights. Through utilising this further, we are able to take this a step further and
        automate this task through a smart gateway and a raspberry pi. The advantage of this is the functionality in contextual
        preferences, if the user wishes to use a standing desk style this is possible with this project, however if they wish to
        take a seat this is also available. Additionally, by being able to save your preferences, you will be able to return to the
        most comfortable position possible for yourself. Moreover, this is also applicable for monitor configuration.
    <br>
    <br>
        Monitor configuration is a challenge found for those who wish to efficiently use multiple monitors in areas such as coding
        and finance. Additionally, multiple monitors are used to also display large amounts of information to analyse it more
        effectively. With the rise of multiple monitors as data driven jobs rise, the ability to be able to move monitors for both
        aesthetic and work efficiency is a must. The vesa mount relieves this to an extent allowing for both rotation and height
        based movements, but it doesn't account for when you find personally optimal configurations. By using a Raspberry Pi to
        remember these configurations, the user will be allowed to work confidently knowing that when they wish to change their
        configuration for another task, it will retain their exact preference to be returned to without any finicky adjustments to
        be made. These adjustments will be controlled through the same controller as the desk itself through either a physical
        controller or through a smart home command.
    <br>
    <br>
        The use of both a smart home command and physical controller is necessary in the use of an automated workspace. Firstly, a
        physical controller enables users who have workspaces a distance away from smart home gateways such as a google home or
        amazon alexa. However, this is merely mountable enabling the user to use their mobile devices as the gateway for audio
        commands to move the desk as well. The connectivity between the smart home gateway device and desk allows for ease of use
        for the user enabling a completely automated experience when changing their desk for any task ahead.
    <br>
    <br>

        For this task, there are a few challenges. The first starting with motorising the desk and vesa mounts. Both motorised
        versions can be expensive, however the alternative is to motorise these items from home. For the desk, this may be easy as
        it works only on a certain plane of motion, upwards and downwards. Whilst, the vesa mount needs to be motorised in all its
        functions and reliable. This leads myself to believe it may be best to try to automate the functions of pre-existing
        motorised mounts available. Additionally, linking a raspberry pi to market available smart home gateways can be tricky due
        to the lack of universal standards used by companies to do so. Finally, fine tuning the monitors to understand the amount
        of space they must operate within can be hard especially as some may be working out of different spaces surrounding the
        desk itself.
    <br>
    <br>
        For constructing automated workstation tools and certain technology will be required. Apart from hand tools, mounts for the
        motors may be needed to be created via 3D printing or CNC to allow for motors to be installed desks. Additionally, a
        Raspberry Pi alongside motors, cables and a google home will be necessary to bring this project to a good level of
        functionality. The Pi itself will need to have code written via a keyboard and monitor. This can be written externally
        and uploaded for ease of use, additionally either sensors or a python based program will be necessary for the vesa mounts
        to understand their working space as well as memorise user settings to return to via the motor. Finally, the raspberry pi
        will need a way to connect to these motors, parts will include breadboards and wiring.

    </p>
    <p>
      Skills:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Mechanical Knowledge</li>
        <li> Basic Understanding of Electrical Circuitry</li>
        <li> Working Understanding of Python</li>
        <li> Knowledge of Raspberry Pi Connection</li>
        <li> WiFi Connectivity for the Raspberry Pi</li>
        <li> Understanding of Google Assistant SDK for Raspberry Pi</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      Understanding the way in which the motors work for both the table legs and vesa mounts will enable the programmer to approach
      the motors most effectively in python.These skills are mostly available through many Raspberry Pi projects that utilise the
      Google Home for remote audio commands. However, this may be an issue as Google has updated the way in which users are able to
      interact with the Google Home from their Raspberry Pi. For the most part, the majority of the knowledge for this project can
      easily be found online, however the level at which it is still applicable with updates could prove troublesome.
    <br>
    <br>
      A successful outcome in this project will enable for a new area of automation from our smart home gateways. The issue being
      solved surrounding personalisation of a workspace at home can actually be scaled outside the office environment and into
      larger tasks such as controlling more niche areas of the home that originally operated on a local and isolated system such as
      garage doors. Through this project being successful, this will enable for users to understand that automation within our
      lives is endless if it enables a level of convenience.
